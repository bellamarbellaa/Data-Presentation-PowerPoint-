In this project, I showcases a cohesive PowerPoint presentation based on my "World Happiness Score Comparison, 2015 - 2020" data analytics project completed in Tableau. 
Designed in Microsoft PowerPoint 2021, the slides feature data visuals directly from my Tableau project on this topic, creating a structured and visually unified presentation. 
Each slide’s speaker notes include in-depth background information, though I’d typically use these as reference rather than reading them verbatim in a live setting.
